Solvig the OP problem we get $VCE=2.1578$

Regarding the gains plots between the first and 2 stage we can see that they do not differ alot, this is beliveble since AV2=-0.0348 db as we can see in the table, so it does not vary much the result.

Nevertheless the inputs and outputs for this stages are present in the following table:


\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{ll}
AV1 & 262.79 \\
ZI1 & 484.43 \\
Z01 & 886.28 \\
AV2 & 0.996  \\
ZI2 & 8598.9 \\
Z02 & 0.302 
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

As such the final gain plot can be given by the following Figure.
