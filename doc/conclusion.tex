\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Comparing these results given by the NGspice with the ones calculated with the octave we can see a clear difference. Therefore, the Merit considered was the one obtained from the Ngspice software, since the analysis made with octave software doesn't seem that of a passband and the results may be less valid. As such, the gain (for the merit calculation) was obtained with the Ngspice program. Overall, the objective of the assignment was still, in great part, achieved, since the circuit was optimized and its functioning understood, through analysis.
