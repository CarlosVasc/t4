\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Comparing these results given by the NGspice with the ones calculated with the octave we can see a clear difference. Therefore, the Merit considered was the one obtained from the Ngspice software, since the analysis made with octave software doesn't seem that of a passband and the results may be less valid. As such, the gain (for the merit calculation) was obtained with the Ngspice program.
