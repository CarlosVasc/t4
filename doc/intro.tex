% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to analyse and optimize an audio amplifier circuit, with a $12V$ supply voltage (Vcc) and an audio input of up to $10mV$, using a gain and an output stage, as presented in Figure  \ref{fig:circuit}. In order to optimize the circuit, it was possible to manipulate the values of several parameters, which had assigned costs, given by the Professor. The \textit{Merit} score is obtained as a function of the chosen architecture's cost and the performance of the circuit.

The parameters changed (in relation to the circuit given by the Professor) are given in Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, along with its cost.


In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, using \textit{Octave}, a theoretical analysis is presented, in which we describe the theoretical model used to analyze the circuit are presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analyzed by simulation, but using the Ngspice software. The conclusions of this study are outlined in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}, where a brief comparative discussion (between Octave and Ngspice results) is made.
